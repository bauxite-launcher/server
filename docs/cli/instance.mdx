# Instance Command-Line Interface

To allow easy/lazy management of a single instance, the `@bauxite/instance-cli` package offers a set of terminal commands that can perform most of the common management tasks offered by the [Instance API](/api/instance).

## Installation

> **Note:** This package has not yet been published to npm &mdash; these installation instructions do not currently work.
>
> For advanced users, you may clone, build and symlink the instance CLI:
>
> ```sh
> git clone https://github.com/bauxite-launcher/server.git
> cd server
> yarn && yarn build && chmod +x ./dist/cli/instance/index.js
> sudo ln -s $(realpath ./dist/cli/instance/index.js) /usr/local/bin/bx-instance
> ```

Installation is possible using `npm` or `yarn`:

```sh
yarn global add @bauxite/instance-cli
```

or

```sh
npm install --global @bauxite/instance-cli
```

## Usage

Once installed, the `bx-instance` command will be available for use in the terminal. You can see a full list of its commands using:

```sh
bx-instance --help
```

Information about a specific command may be accessed in a similar fashion:

```sh
bx-instance install --help
```

You may also check the current version using:

```sh
bx-instance --version
```

## Global Options

The following options apply to all available commands, except where noted.

### `--directory` _(required)_

This is the only required option, specifying the absolute path to the instance's directory on disk. By default, the current working directory will be used.

Alternatively, this option be supplied using the `BAUXITE_DIRECTORY` environment variable.

### `--colour` / `--color`

If set, terminal output will be colourised. To disable this, the `--no-colour` or `--no-color` flag may be passed.

Alternatively, this option be supplied using the `BAUXITE_COLOUR` environment variable.

### `--emoji`

Some commands use emojis in their output. To disable this, the `--no-emoji` flag may be used.

Alternatively, this option be supplied using the `BAUXITE_EMOJI` environment variable.

### `--json`

With most commands, this flag can be set to output JSON instead of human-readable text. This is useful if you want to use this CLI tool from other scripts/applications.

Alternatively, this option be supplied using the `BAUXITE_JSON` environment variable.


> For all of the examples for the following commands, we are installing an instance using the `BAUXITE_DIRECTORY` environment variable to tell Bauxite where our instance lives.

> export BAUXITE_DIRECTORY=/path/to/instance

# Roadmap

As much as possible, semantic versioning will be respected. Bauxite is an ambitious project
with a lengthy roadmap for a single developer to complete, so please don't rely on its existance
for anything critical. There will be no npm release of anything before v0.5.0, as it is still
early days, and I don't plan for anybody to adopt this yet.

## Version 0.1.0 (completed)

The bare minimum to get a vanilla Minecraft instance installed, and launched.
And some other stuff, because why not?

- [x] Basic File APIs
  - [x] [`TextFile`](/api/file/TextFile)
  - [x] [`JsonFile`](/api/file/JsonFile)
  - [x] [`JsonCollectionFile`](/api/file/JsonCollectionFile)
  - [x] [`RemoteFile`](/api/file/RemoteFile)
- [x] Basic Instance API
  - [x] Minecraft server installation
  - [x] Server process management (start/stop)
  - [x] [server.properties][server.properties] management
  - [x] Log file management (parse/tail)
  - [x] Ops/whitelist/usercache
- [x] Instance CLI
  - [x] Status
  - [x] Install/upgrade
  - [x] Start/stop
  - [x] Server proeprties
  - [x] Logs

## Version 0.2.0 (in progress)

In order to launch modded servers, 1st class support for [Minecraft Forge][forge] is necessary.
This version adds the bare minimum to get Forge installed and launching.

- [x] Forge support
  - [x] Forge server installation
  - [ ] Launch Forge server when available
  - [x] Adapt status CLI command
  - [x] Adapt install CLI command
- [ ] Forge mod support
  - [ ] List installed mods
  - [ ] Install mod from filepath/URL

## Version 0.3.0

- [ ] Install mod from CurseForge project ID/URL
- [ ] Find compatible updates for mods installed from CurseForge

## Version 0.4.0

- [ ] Install modpack instance from CurseForge project ID/URL
- [ ] Update modpacks installed from CurseForge
- [ ] npm release:
  - [ ] @bauxite/instance-api
  - [ ] @bauxite/instance-cli

## Version 0.5.0

- [ ] Almost everything stateful becomes an EventEmitter
- [ ] GraphQL API with subscriptions ([Apollo][apollo], probably)
- [ ] Websocket bindings (maybe local unix socket bindings)

## Version 0.6.0

- [ ] Containerisation of instances, probably using [LXD][lxd]
- [ ] Basic "controller" API (manages multiple instances, nomenclature TBC), via GraphQL instance API + containers

## Version 0.7.0

- [ ] GraphQL API for "controller" (again websocket, maybe unix socket)
- [ ] Web UI for for "controller"
- [ ] Public-facing web dashboard for statistics/map etc.

## Other

These features are things I want to add, but haven't really thought through (or don't add much value),
and will probably bring into the roadmap as I go.

- [ ] Wizard CLI (as frontend for existing CLI)
- [ ] Mod configuration
- [ ] "controller" option groups (i.e. presets)
- [ ] [Dynmap][dynmap] integration
  - [ ] Web UI / public dashboard
- [ ] World management
- [ ] Backup management
  - [ ] Via LXD + copy-on-write filesystem
  - [ ] Via Forge mod (i.e. [AromaBackup][aroma])
- [ ] Browser extensions (Chrome/FF) to launch instances from CurseForge project pages

# `ForgeReleaseList` class

A utility class for fetching and querying the unofficial [Minecraft Forge version API][forge-version-api]. The version data is cached in memory for quick re-use.

> **Note:** Minecraft Forge uses advertising to generate revenue, and we would be nothing without Forge. When implementing a tool that uses this API, you are bypassing those advertisments. If you want to support the developers of Minecraft Forge, an adfocus ID is provided in the raw data of this file, accessible via the `read` instance method.

This class extends [`RemoteFile`](/api/file/RemoteFile).

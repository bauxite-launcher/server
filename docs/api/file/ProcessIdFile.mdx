# `ProcessIdFile` class

Represents the `instance.pid` file within a server instance directory; it stores the process ID of the currently running Minecraft/Forge server instance.

This class extends [`TextFile`](./TextFile).

When reading, if the file does not exist, then `null` is returned. When writing, if no new value is specified, then the file is deleted.

In other words, the file can only exist while a value is specified &mdash; no value means no file.

# `RemoteFile` class

A utility class that reads from a remote file over HTTP(S).

## Example Usage

### Reading content of remote file

```js
const remoteFile = new RemoteFile("https://example.com/file.txt");

const fileContent = await remoteFile.read();
```

### Streaming contents of remote file

```js
const remoteFile = new RemoteFile("https://example.com/file.txt");
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream("/path/to/file.txt");

const readStream = await remoteFile.stream();
readStream.pipe(writeStream);
```

> _Note:_ This is a contrived example. The heavy lifting of downloading a remote file can be performed using `TextFile.createFromRemoteFile`.

## Static Methods

### `constructor`

Instantiates a new `RemoteFile`.

#### Parameters

1. `url: string`

   The remote URL of the file.

2. `fetchOptions?: FetchOptions`

   An optional set of options to pass to [`node-fetch`][node-fetch]. These options will be used when requesting the remote file.

## Instance Methods

### `read`

Reads the content of the remote file. Behaves identically to [`TextFile.prototype.read`](./TextFile).

### `fetch`

Performs a fetch of the remote file using [`node-fetch`][node-fetch].

To get the text content of the file (or a stream of the file content), use `read` or `readStream` specifically.

#### Parameters

_none_

#### Return Value

Returns a fetch response object.

[node-fetch]: https://npmjs.com/package/node-fetch

### `readRaw`

Returns the raw text content of the remote file.

#### Parameters

_none_

#### Return Value

Returns a Promise that resolves with the text content of the remote file.

### `readStream`

Returns a readable stream of the remote file content.

#### Parameters

_none_

#### Return Value

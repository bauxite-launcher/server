# `TextFile` class

A utility class which reads and writes from a text file on disk.
Once read, the file will be cached in memory for quick access.

It can be extended to implement classes for formatted files (i.e. JSON and other text formats).

## Example Usage

### Reading from a file on disk

```js
const file = new TextFile("/path/to/file.txt");

const fileContent = await file.read();
```

### Writing to a file on disk

```js
const file = new TextFile("/path/to/file.txt");

await file.write("new file content");
```

### Extending to parse formatted files

Here, we make a new class that can read and write JSON files.
`TextFile` will automatically call `parse` and `serialize` if they are overridden.
This will automatically cache the _parsed_ value of the file on the first read, to allow fast repeated reads.

```js
class JsonFile extends TextFile {
  static parse(rawValue) {
    return JSON.parse(rawValue);
  }

  static serialize(value) {
    return JSON.stringify(value, null, 2);
  }
}
```

> _Note:_ this is actually a simplified version of how [JsonFile](./JsonFile) is implemented

## Properties

### `path` _(string)_

The absolute path to the file, i.e. `"/path/to/file.txt"`

### `name` _(read-only string)_

Just the filename part of the path, without the directory, i.e. `"file.txt"`

### `directory` _(read-only string)_

Just the directory part of the path, without the filename, i.e. `/path/to/`

## Static Methods

### `constructor`

Instantiates a new `TextFile`.

#### Parameters

1. `path: string`

   The absolute local filepath to the file.

2. `encoding?: string`

   Optionally, the encoding to use when reading the file. By default, this is 'utf8'.

### `createFromRemoteFile`

Downloads the contents of a [`RemoteFile`](./RemoteFile) to disk,
and returns a Promise to a `TextFile` representing it.

#### Example

The following example downloads the remote file to `/path/to/file.txt`.

```js
const remoteFile = new RemoteFile("http://example.com/file.txt");
const localCopy = await TextFile.createFromRemoteFile(remoteFile, "/path/to");
```

#### Parameters

1. `remoteFile: RemoteFile`

   The remote file to download

2. `directory: string`

   The local directory into which the remote file will be downloaded.

3. `name?: string`

   The name of the file to create. If omitted, it will fallback to using the remote file's `Content-Disposition` header to extract the original filename.

4. `encoding?: string`

   The encoding to use for the remote file. If omitted, it will fallback to using the remote file's `Content-Disposition` header to extract the original file encoding.

5. `onProgress?: (progress: StreamProgressEvent) => void`

   An optional callback that will be called as the download progresses. This uses [`stream-progress`][stream-progress] internally.

#### Return Value

Returns a Promise, that will resolve with an instance of `TextFile`.

### `createFromStream`

Writes a file to disk from any [`ReadableStream`][readable-stream], and then returns a Promise to a `TextFile` representing it.

> _Note:_ You probably want to use `createFromRemoteFile`, which handles most of the heavy lifting of downloading a file.

#### Parameters

1. `path: string`

   The local path into which the file will be written.

2. `readStream: ReadableStream`

   A [`ReadableStream`][readable-stream] from which the file content should be read.

3. `encoding?: string`

   The encoding to use for the remote file. If omitted, it will fallback to `'utf8'`.

4. `onProgress?: (progress: StreamProgressEvent) => void`

   An optional callback that will be called as the download progresses. This uses [`stream-progress`][stream-progress] internally.

5. `expectedLength?: number`

   If `onProgress` is provided, an `expectedLength` must also be provided, to allow progress events to calculate stream completion. It represents the size of the file in bytes.

#### Return Value

Returns a Promise, that will resolve with an instance of `TextFile`.

### `validate`

This method throws an error is the supplied string is empty.
This is largely useless in `TextFile`, and is mostly intended to be overridden in extending classes.

`validate` is called by `write` with the new value (before serialization). It should be used to throw an error to prevent writes with invalid data.

#### Parameters

1. `value: string | ParsedTextFileContent`

   The new content of the file to be validated. If no `parse` method is specified on the instance, then `value` will be a string; otherwise it will be the return type of `parse`.

#### Return Value

_none_

## Instance Methods

### `writeFromStream`

Writes to the file on disk from any [`ReadableStream`][readable-stream].

#### Parameters

1. `readStream: ReadableStream`

   A [`ReadableStream`][readable-stream] from which the file content should be read.

2. `onProgress?: (progress: StreamProgressEvent) => void`

   An optional callback that will be called as the download progresses. This uses [`stream-progress`][stream-progress] internally.

3. `expectedLength?: number`

   If `onProgress` is provided, an `expectedLength` must also be provided, to allow progress events to calculate stream completion. It represents the size of the file in bytes.

#### Return Value

Returns a Promise which resolves with nothing.

### `read`

Reads the file from disk. If the file has been read previously, a cached copy from memory is returned instead.

If a `parse` instance method is defined, it will be used to parse the file before returning. The parsed version will be cached instead of the raw contents of the file.

#### Parameters

1. `bypassCache?: boolean`

   If supplied (and truthy), the cache will be bypassed and the file will be read fresh from disk. If not supplied (or falsy), the cache will be used as normal.

#### Return Value

Returns a Promise which resolves the parsed content of the file.

### `write`

Writes a file to disk. The new value will be used to update the in-memory cache.

If a `serialize` instance method is defined, it will be used to serialize the file before writing.

#### Parameters

1. `newValue: string | ParsedTextFileContent`

   The new (parsed) value of the file to write.

#### Return Value

Returns a Promise which resolves with nothing.

### `readRaw`

Reads the raw content of a file, bypassing the cache and any `parse` method that may be defined.

#### Parameters

_none_

#### Return Value

Returns a Promise that resolves with a string.

### `writeRaw`

Writes the raw content of a file, bypassing the cache and any `serialize` method that may be defined.

#### Parameters

1. `newRawValue: string`

   The new (raw) value of the file to write.

### `delete`

Deletes the file from disk.

#### Parameters

_none_

#### Return Value

A Promise that resolves with nothing.

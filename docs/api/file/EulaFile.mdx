# `EulaFile` class

Represents the `eula.txt` file within a server instance directory.

The file is used to mark the Minecraft/Mojang EULA as accepted (or not).

This class extends [`TextFile`](./TextFile).

## File Format

The file itself looks something like this:

```
# Generated by @bauxite/instance-api v0.3.0 at <timestamp>
eula=false
```

Normally, when performing a manual installation of Minecraft server, the user must set `eula=true` themselves. This class can be used to read/write a boolean representing whether the EULA has been agreed.

## Static Methods

### `header`

Generates a header for the EULA file, specifying the version of Bauxite and the time at which the file was last written to.

For example:

```
# Generated by @bauxite/instance-api v0.3.0 at <timestamp>
```

## Instance Methods

### `read`

Returns a Promise that resolves with either `true` or `false`, depending on whether the EULA has been agreed to by the user.

### `write`

Accepts a boolean representing whether the user agrees to the EULA, and updates the EULA file accordingly.

### `accept`

A helper method that updates the EULA file to show the user has accepts the terms.

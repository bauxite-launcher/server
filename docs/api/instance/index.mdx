### `installer` _([`MinecraftInstaller`](./Installer))_

An `Installer` for the instance.

### `forgeInstaller` _([`ForgeInstaller`](./ForgeInstaller))_

A `ForgeInstaller` for the instance.

### `logs` _([`LogManager`](./LogManager))_

## Static Methods

### `constructor`

Instantiates a new `Instance`.

#### Parameters

1. `path: directory`

   The absolute local filepath to the instance's directory. If the directory does not exist, it will be created when its `install` method is called.

2. `settings?: SettingsFile`

   An optional `SettingsFile`. Not useful for the majority of cases - may be removed in the future. If not supplied, one will be automatically created.

3. `properties?: ServerPropertiesFile`

   An optional `ServerPropertiesFile`.  Not useful for the majority of cases - may be removed in the future. If not supplied, one will be automatically created.

### `create`

Creates a new `Instance` and installs it based on some initial settings.

#### Parameters

1. `path: directory`

   The absolute local filepath to the instance's directory. If the directory does not exist, it will be created when its `install` method is called.

2. `settings: { minecraftVersion: string }`

   An object containing the initial settings to use to install the instance. Currently, only the `minecraftVersion` key is used â”€ other values may be added in future.

3. `onProgress?: InstallStateSubscriber`

   An optional callback to fire with progress updates from the installation process. See the documentation for [`MinecraftInstaller.install`](./Installer) for further information on this callback.

#### Return values

Returns a Promise, which resolves with a new `MinecraftInstance`, having installed Minecraft.

## Instance Methods

### `path`

Returns a path, relative to the instance's directory root. This is essentially [`path.resolve`][path-resolve] with the instance directory bound as its first parameter.

#### Example Usage

Given a `MinecraftInstance`, constructed like so:

```js
const instance = new MinecraftInstance('/path/to/instance');
```

Then, calling `instance.path` with no parameters returns the instance directory as-is:

```js
instance.path() // => /path/to/instance
```

Similarly, calling `instance.path` with a relative file path will resolve that path within the instance directory:

```js
instance.path('someFile.txt') // => /path/to/instance/someFile.txt
```

Finally, given that this method is based on Node's built-in [`path.resolve`][path-resolve] function, you may pass it as many arguments as you like:

```js
instance.path('some/other', 'path', 'inside', 'someFile.json')
// => /path/to/instance/some/other/path/inside/someFile.json
```

#### Parameters

Accepts zero or more string arguments (i.e. the method is variadic), each representing a component of the path.

#### Return Value

Returns a string representing an absolute path to a file/folder within the instance directory. See the **Example Usage** section above for more information.

### `launch`

A convenience method that calls the starts the Minecraft instance. This is a wrapper around [`InstanceProcess.launch`](./InstanceProcess).

#### Return Value

Returns a Promise, that resolves when the instance process has been launched.

### `kill`

A convenience method that calls the stops the Minecraft instance. This is a wrapper around [`InstanceProcess.kill`](./InstanceProcess).

#### Return Value

Returns a Promise, that resolves when the instance process has been stopped.

### `isRunning`

A convenience method that can be used to determine whether the instance is currently running. This is a wrapper around [`InstanceProcess.isRunning`](./InstanceProcess)

#### Return Value

Returns a Promise, that resolves with a boolean. If that boolean is true, then the instance is running; otherwise it is not running.

### `isInstalled`

A convenience method to quickly determine whether Minecraft server has been installed on this instance.

#### Return Value

Returns a Promise, that resolves with a boolean. If this boolean is true, then Minecraft server is installed.

### `getInstallState`

A convenience method that returns the current install state of the instance. This is a wrapper around [`Installer.getInstallState`](./Installer)

#### Return Value

Returns a Promise, that resolves with an `InstallState`.

### `install`

Installs a specific version of the Minecraft server into the instance.

#### Parameters

1. `minecraftVersionId: string`

   The version ID of Minecraft to install, e.g. `"1.13.2"`.

2. `onProgress?: InstallStateSubscriber`

   An optional callback to fire with progress updates from the installation process. See the documentation for [`MinecraftInstaller.install`](./Installer) for further information on this callback.

3. `force?: boolean`

   If true, then the installation will not perform any preflight checks. In other words, it will override any existing installations.

### `isForgeInstalled`

A convenience method to quickly determine whether Minecraft Forge server has been installed on this instance.

#### Return Value

Returns a Promise, that resolves with a boolean. If this boolean is true, then Minecraft Forge server is installed.

### `getForgeInstallState`

A convenience method that returns the current Forge installation state of the instance. This is a wrapper around [`ForgeInstaller.getInstallState`](./Installer)

#### Return Value

Returns a Promise, that resolves with a `ForgeInstallState`.

### `installForge`

Installs a specific version of Minecraft Forge server into the instance.

#### Parameters

1. `forgeVersionId: string`

   The version ID of Minecraft Forge to install, e.g. `"14.123.3222"`.

2. `onProgress?: ForgeInstallStateSubscriber`

   An optional callback to fire with progress updates from the installation process. See the documentation for [`ForgeInstaller.install`](./ForgeInstaller) for further information on this callback.

3. `force?: boolean`

   If true, then the installation will not perform any preflight checks. In other words, it will override any existing installations.

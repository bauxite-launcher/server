[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/bauxite-launcher/server/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/bauxite-launcher/server/tree/master)

Bauxite Server provides a suite of tools and APIs for managing Minecraft servers.

Follow one of the following links for more information:

- [JavaScript APIs](./docs/APIs/index.md)
- [Command-line Tools](./docs/CLIs/index.md)
- _Desktop Applications (in the future)_

Please note that Bauxite is a work in progress -- semver will be followed as best as possible, but APIs are likely to change rapidly before v1.0.0 is released.
